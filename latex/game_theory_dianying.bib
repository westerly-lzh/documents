Abstract = {The paper presents research on the application of a game theoretic model to electronic books (e-books) and electronic readers (e-readers) pricing within wholesale and agency pricing models. It analyzes pricing strategies among a publisher and retailer to identify a complementary relationship between e-readers and e-books and the cause for low e-book prices. It compares wholesale and agency pricing models, accounts for market conditions, and effects of pricing on e-book consumption. It offers evidence of lower e-book reader prices, business profit, and social welfare in the agency model, and suggests that publishers are disadvantaged under an agency pricing model.},
